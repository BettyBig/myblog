            <h1>HELLO</h1>
            <p>From a girl by the name Betty. This is her first exam in web development. She have always been obessed with anything tech, she loves challenges or should we say, she is obessed with anything that pushes her to challenge herself, so tech turns that obession to reality anytime she get to sit with the system and solve a particular problem. Tech challenges her to push herself further,  Tech is a way of her expressing herself by staying behind the scene and solving problems and making money from it. I hope this little details made sense and you now know a little about Betty and why she is in the tech industry today.</p>
